# TravelMate
It is a minor project in which we develop only front-end of the website. I lead a team of three members. My responsibilities include HTML, CSS, and some UI features.

It is a website to facilitate ridesharing between college students.
TravelMate revolutionizes solo travel for university students by offering a specialized online platform designed to connect individuals embarking on similar journeys. TravelMate fills this void by providing a user-friendly website that facilitates connections between university students traveling solo.
Through TravelMate, students can input their locations/routes, available seats and preferences. Leveraging innovative algorithms, the platform matches individuals with compatible travel companions who are journeying along the same route during overlapping time frames, creating opportunities for cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation options. TravelMate fostering meaningful connections from the outset. It also promotes sustainable transportation.

Overall, the student transportation system not only provides a practical solution to transportation challenges faced by college students but also promotes a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of commuting. By empowering students to connect, collaborate, and share resources, the project contributes to building a stronger and more connected college community.

So, our project TravelMate is a website working towards providing the interaction between two types of students: one who is going to drive and the other one who needs a driver companion and then our website comes into play providing them to communicate and settle their journey.
